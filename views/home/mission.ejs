		<p>Food is one of the basic necessities of humans, and it stands first among all basic needs - food, 
			shelter, and clothing. It is important as it nourishes the human body- sustaining the very 
			existences of humans. However, with the rising population and development of this country, 
			food wastage has risen to a new high.</p>
			<p>Despite phenomenal industrial and economic growth and while India produces sufficient food 
				to feed its population, it is unable to provide access to food to a large number of people. 
				According to FAO estimates in â€˜The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World, 2020 
				report, 189.2 million people are undernourished in India. By this measure 14% of the 
				population is undernourished in India. According to the latest survey, 1.3 billion tons of food 
				is thrown as waste every year.Additionally, one-third of the food consumed is stated as leftovers.</p>
				<p> The main Goal of Annadaan is to reduce the amount of food wasted and being provided to the needy people.</p>
